	<h1> My Love for Fishing & Technology </h1>
	<img src = "media-folder/pic3.png" alt = "Picture of fish"/>
	<p>
		I was always an outdoor child growing up. I would immerse myself in nature.
 I was always in the yard digging up worms or catching spiders.
 Eventually I got into fishing and my obsession with the outdoors really took off.
 I was riding my bike out of my Southside neighborhood to the suburbs to fish whenever I could.
Eventually I got my drive's license and a car. With this came fishing at locations my bike couldn't reach.
When I was 17 I took a Computer Science class. To my surprise I really liked it.

		Similiar to fishing, coding was a lot of problem solving and I loved that. It was a new challenge to me and it pushed me out of my comfort zone.
I realized that if I set my mind to it, I could bring technology & fishing together.
I went away to college at Indiana Tech to play baseball and study computer science.
I chose Indiana because it had a decent program and three rivers to fish right by the school. 
Go figure fishing had a role to play in one of the biggest decisions of my life.
Once I realized that I needed to come back to Chicago, I knew IIT was the best option.
I am working on a fishing App right now with another student I met here.
I also fish the 31st Harbor every chance I get to sneak away between classes.
